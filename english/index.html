            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Stian Lilleng. I am residing in Brønnøysund and working as a Senior Consultant at Brønnøysundregistrene, where I have been employed since 2003. In 2023
              I decided to start studying Frontend Development at Noroff via online studies.
            </p>
            <p>
              It has been an exciting learning process with a lot of creativity and we
              have visited many exciting topics in everything from design to
              user testing, and the most common coding languages such as html, css and
              JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this portfolio I intend to show the various projects I have made during the study period.

                <p>
                  This was our first exam project. The project involved creating a website for a blog where we were supposed to create the blog posts on Wordpress and fetch them using the Wordpress API and JavaScript. The choice of theme for the blog was optional, and I chose to combine some of my personal hobbies in what I personally think became a fun website. I also tried out Midjourney for the first time in this project.

                <p>
                  This was our first semester project. The task was to create a website for a fictional community science museum. The goal was to showcase what we had learned in HTML and CSS so far. The website was expected to have 4-6 pages and be tailored to a primary age group of 7-15 years. It was a fun project with plenty of room for creativity.

                <p>
                  This is my Cross Course Project. It's a website we have been working on since the beginning of the study and has been built upon multiple times. SquareEyes is a platform for purchasing movies, initially created with only HTML and CSS. It has later been enhanced with JavaScript, and hard-coded products have been replaced with dynamic data from a WordPress API. I refer to this site as a "patchwork" since it was the first website I ever created, and it has undergone several additions and improvements since then.
